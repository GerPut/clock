Clock

In this project I created a digital clock. I used HTML, SASS/CSS and Javascript to complete this very basic project. The site is responsive with a navbar. The clock displays time. I wrote a basic function with methods to get the date, hours, minutes and seconds. 

I learned more about Sass and how it works. The project took 2 days to complete.
