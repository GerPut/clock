## Clock Project

In this project I created a digital clock. I used HTML, SASS/CSS and Javascript to complete this very basic project. The site is responsive with a navbar. The clock displays time. I wrote a basic function with methods to get the date, hours, minutes and seconds. A second function was added that also get the current time then checking some conditions to display a specific message depending on what time of the day it is. 

I learned more about Sass and how it works. The project took 2 days to complete.
